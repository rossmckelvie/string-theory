In String Theory, you play as the last Hero String, a photon sphere, protecting the fabric of the universe from Anti Strings. If you fail your mission the universe will fall apart.

Your movement is controlled by the WASD keys. Aiming is controlled by the location of the pointer, and firing the weapon is done by clicking the left button.

Enemies cannot shoot at the player, but try to collide with you.

The longer you last without dying and the more enemies you defeat, the higher your score.
