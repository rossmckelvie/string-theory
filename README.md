## Story
In String Theory, you play as the last Hero String, a photon sphere, protecting the fabric of the universe from Anti Strings. Anti Strings have bonded together and evolved to create five species of intelligent opponents that are warping space time which will eventually tear the universe apart.

If you collide with an Anti String, part of your energy is annihilated. You can take three hits before you are erased from the universe.

When you fail your mission the universe will fall apart. Fear not, you can restart time and try again.

The longer you last without dying and the more enemies you defeat, the higher your score.

## Controls
Movement is controlled by the WASD or Arrow keys.

Aiming is controlled using the mouse to aim the crosshairs.

Firing the weapon is done by clicking or holding the left button.

Bombs are activated with the spacebar.

## Enemies
Enemies enter from one of the four corners and have AI as described below:

``Triangle`` moves slowly towards the player

``Square`` randomly chooses a new path at a regular interval: move in a random direction or towards the player. Move speed is identical to the player's.

``Circle`` enters the map and orbits a point at a random distance. If left alive for too long, enrages and moves directly towards the player at high speed.

``Worm`` move path is chosen like the square, except the worm has a tail. Shooting part of the tail reduces its length by one. Shooting it in the head destroys the entire worm. Move speed is identical to the player's.

``Black Hole`` unlike other enemies, the black hole does not move and does not enter from the corners. Fades in a random location and has a gravitational field that sucks in enemies. It's score and health value are increased as enemies are absorbed. Shooting a black hole reduces it's health, allowing for more enemies to be absorbed before it explodes. As a black hole nears the explosion point, its pulse rate is increased. When a black hole explodes, small red enemies are released that move at extremely high speeds towards the players. Use black holes to contain your enemies, but don't let them stay alive and unhurt too long.
